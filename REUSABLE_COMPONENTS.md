# Reusable components

Every agnostic component (UI control, extension, helper, etc) should be created in a separate repository and in Swift.

Your component should be unit tested and documented.

# Steps to create a component

- [ ] Use this template: https://github.com/JohnSundell/SwiftPlate - it will automatically add support for CocoaPods, Carthage, and Swift Package Manager.
- [ ] Create a local folder with your project name and run `swiftplate` from there
- [ ] 👶  Author: Your own name
- [ ] 📫  Author email: hello@bakkenbaeck.no
- [ ] 🌍  GitHub URL: https://github.com/bakkenbaeck/<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
- [ ] 🏢  Organization Name: Bakken & Bæck

# Steps to ship a component

- [ ] Make sure that the README states what makes this component different than the other ones - simply having been made by us is probably not enough. It's very important that your README is 🌟 fabulous 🌟.
- [ ] Provide a super-simple example on how to get the component up and running. 
- [ ] If the component is dependent on other frameworks, explain why they're needed them and what they do. Don't assume that people know everything.
- [ ] If it's a visual component, include a `.gif` showing how it works or what it does. It helps people understand your component without having to clone, build and run your project.
- [ ] Make sure to have a cool logo 😎

## Publicizing your component

Always express that you are part of a team, use phrases like **"We did this"** rather than **"I did this"**.

Take the time to compose personal tweets to all your recipients.  Copy-pasting one message to everyone makes you sound like a robot and feels spammy -- don't do this.

- [ ] Submit your component to [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). your post should start with **Show HN**
