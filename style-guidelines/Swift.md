## Naming

Use descriptive names with camel case for classes, methods, variables, etc. Class names and constants in module scope should be capitalized, while method names and variables should start with a lower case letter.

**Preferred:**

```swift
let MaximumWidgetCount = 100

class WidgetContainer {
    var widgetButton: UIButton
    let widgetHeightPercentage = 0.85
}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
let MAX_WIDGET_COUNT = 100

class app_widgetContainer {
    var wBut: UIButton
    let wHeightPct = 0.85
}
```

For functions and init methods, prefer named parameters for all arguments unless the context is very clear. Include external parameter names if it makes function calls more readable.

```swift
func dateFromString(dateString: String) -> NSDate { ... }
func convertPointAt(column column: Int, row: Int) -> CGPoint { ... }
func timedAction(delay delay: NSTimeInterval, perform action: SKAction) -> SKAction! { ... }

// would be called like this:
dateFromString("2014-03-14") { ... }
convertPointAt(column: 42, row: 13) { ... }
timedAction(delay: 1.0, perform: someOtherAction) { ... }
```

For methods, follow the standard Apple convention of referring to the first parameter in the method name:
```swift
class Guideline {
    func combineWithString(incoming: String, options: Dictionary?) { ... }
    func upvoteBy(amount: Int) { ... }
}
```

When referring to functions in prose include the required parameter names from the caller's perspective. If the context is clear and the exact signature is not important, you can use just the method name.

> Call `convertPointAt(column:row:)` from your own `init` implementation.
>
> If you implement `timedAction`, remember to provide an appropriate delay value.
>
> You shouldn't call the data source method `tableView(_:cellForRowAtIndexPath:)` directly.

When in doubt, look at how Xcode lists the method in the jump bar – our style here matches that.

### Class Prefixes

Swift types are all automatically namespaced by the module that contains them. As a result, prefixes are not required in order to minimize naming collisions. If two names from different modules collide you can disambiguate by prefixing the type name with the module name:

```swift
import MyModule

var myClass = MyModule.MyClass()
```

You **should not** add prefixes to your Swift types.

If you need to expose a Swift type for use within Objective-C you can provide a suitable prefix (following our [Objective-C style guide](https://github.com/bakkenbaeck/iOS-playbook/blob/master/style-guidelines/ObjC.md)) as follows:

```swift
@objc (RWTChicken) class Chicken {
    ...
}
```


## Spacing and Indentation

* Indent using 4 spaces rather than tabs to conserve space and help prevent line wrapping. This should be configured on the project.

  ![Xcode indent settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bakkenbaeck/iOS-playbook/master/assets/xcode-text-settings-swift.png)

* Method braces and other braces (`if`/`else`/`switch`/`while` etc.) always open on the same line as the statement but close on a new line.
* Tip: You can re-indent by selecting some code (or ⌘A to select all) and then Control-I (or Editor\Structure\Re-Indent in the menu). Some of the Xcode template code will have 4-space tabs hard coded, so this is a good way to fix that.

**Preferred:**
```swift
if user.isHappy {
    // Do something
} else {
    // Do something else
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
if user.isHappy
{
  // Do something
}
else {
  // Do something else
}
```

* There should be exactly one blank line between methods to aid in visual clarity and organization. Whitespace within methods should separate functionality, but having too many sections in a method often means you should refactor into several methods.


## Classes and Structs

Unless you require functionality that can only be provided by a class, implement a struct instead.

Additional capabilities of classes:

- Inheritance: Enables one class to inherit the characteristics of another
- Type casting: Enables you to check and interpret the type of a class instance at runtime
- Deinitializers: Enable an instance of a class to free up any resources it has assigned
- Reference counting: Allows more than one reference to a class instance
- Compatibility: Classes are available from Objetive-C

### Use of Self

Use `self` when required, for example:

- When using optional binding with optional properties

**Preferred:**

```swift
if let textContainer = self.textContainer {
    // do many things with textContainer
}
```

**Not Preferred:**

```swift
if let maybeThisCouldBeTextContainer = textContainer {
    // do many things with maybeThisCouldBeTextContainer
}
```

- To differentiate between property names and arguments in initializers
- When referencing properties in closure expressions

```swift
init(row: Int, column: Int) {
    self.row = row
    self.column = column

    let closure = {
      println(self.row)
    }
}
```

### Protocol Conformance

When adding protocol conformance to a class, prefer adding a separate class extension for the protocol methods. This keeps the related methods grouped together with the protocol and can simplify instructions to add a protocol to a class with its associated methods.

Also, don't forget the `// MARK: -` comment to keep things well-organized!

**Preferred:**
```swift
class MyViewcontroller: UIViewController {
    // class stuff here
}

// MARK: - UITableViewDataSource
extension MyViewcontroller: UITableViewDataSource {
    // table view data source methods
}

// MARK: - UIScrollViewDelegate
extension MyViewcontroller: UIScrollViewDelegate {
    // scroll view delegate methods
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
class MyViewcontroller: UIViewController, UITableViewDataSource, UIScrollViewDelegate {
    // all methods
}
```


### Computed Properties

For conciseness, if a computed property is read-only, omit the get clause. The get clause is required only when a set clause is provided.

**Preferred:**
```swift
var diameter: Double {
    return radius * 2.0
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
var diameter: Double {
    get {
      return radius * 2.0
    }
}
```

### Example definition

Here's an example of a well-styled class definition:

```swift
class Circle: Shape {
    var x: Int, y: Int
    var radius: Double

    var diameter: Double {
        get {
            return radius * 2.0
        }
        set {
            radius = newValue / 2.0
        }
    }

    init(x: Int, y: Int, radius: Double) {
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.radius = radius
    }

    convenience init(x: Int, y: Int, diameter: Double) {
        self.init(x: x, y: y, radius: diameter / 2.0)
    }

    func describe() -> String {
        return "I am a circle at \(centerString()) with an area of \(computeArea())"
    }

    override func computeArea() -> Double {
        return M_PI * radius * radius
    }

    private func centerString() -> String {
        return "(\(x),\(y))"
    }
}
```

The example above demonstrates the following style guidelines:

 + The correct spacing for variable assignations is with a space after and before the equals mark `=`, e.g. `x = 3`
 + Attributes in method signature have the `:` next to the name, e.g `init(x: Int, y: Int)` same with class inheritance and when using type inference
 + Define multiple variables and structures on a single line if they share a common purpose/context
 + Indent getter and setter definitions and property observers
 + Don't add modifiers such as `internal` when they're already the default. Similarly, don't repeat the access modifier when overriding a method


## Function Declarations

Keep short function declarations on one line including the opening brace:

```swift
func reticulateSplines(spline: [Double]) -> Bool {
    // reticulate code goes here
}
```

For functions with long signatures, add line breaks at appropriate points and add an extra indent on subsequent lines:

```swift
func reticulateSplines(
    spline: [Double],
    adjustmentFactor: Double,
    translateConstant: Int,
    comment: String) -> Bool {
    // reticulate code goes here
}
```


## Closure Expressions

Use trailing closure syntax wherever possible. In all cases, give the closure parameters descriptive names:

```swift
return SKAction.customActionWithDuration(effect.duration) { node, elapsedTime in
    // more code goes here
}
```

For single-expression closures where the context is clear, use implicit returns:

```swift
attendeeList.sort { a, b in
    a > b
}
```


## Types

Always use Swift's native types when available. Swift offers bridging to Objective-C so you can still use the full set of methods as needed.

**Preferred:**
```swift
let width = 120.0                                    // Double
let widthString = (width as NSNumber).stringValue    // String
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let width: NSNumber = 120.0                                 // NSNumber
let widthString: NSString = width.stringValue               // NSString
```

In Sprite Kit code, use `CGFloat` if it makes the code more succinct by avoiding too many conversions.


### Constants

Constants are defined using the `let` keyword, and variables with the `var` keyword. Any value that **is** a constant **must** be defined appropriately, using the `let` keyword. As a result, you will likely find yourself using `let` far more than `var`.

**Tip:** One technique that might help meet this standard is to define everything as a constant and only change it to a variable when the compiler complains!


### Optionals

Declare variables and function return types as optional with `?` where a nil value is acceptable.

Use implicitly unwrapped types declared with `!` only for instance variables that you know will be initialized later before use, such as subviews that will be set up in `viewDidLoad`.

When accessing an optional value, use optional chaining if the value is only accessed once or if there are many optionals in the chain:

```swift
textContainer?.textLabel?.setNeedsDisplay()
```

Use optional binding when it's more convenient to unwrap once and perform multiple operations:

```swift
if let textContainer = self.textContainer {
    // do many things with textContainer
}
```

When naming optional variables and properties, avoid naming them like `optionalString` or `maybeView` since their optional-ness is already in the type declaration.

For optional binding, shadow the original name when appropriate rather than using names like `unwrappedView` or `actualLabel`.

**Preferred:**
```swift
var subview: UIView?

// later on...
if let subview = subview {
    // do something with unwrapped subview
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
var optionalSubview: UIView?

if let unwrappedSubview = optionalSubview {
    // do something with unwrappedSubview
}
```


### Struct Initializers

Use the native Swift struct initializers rather than the legacy CGGeometry constructors.

**Preferred:**
```swift
let bounds = CGRect(x: 40.0, y: 20.0, width: 120.0, height: 80.0)
var centerPoint = CGPoint(x: 96.0, y: 42.0)
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let bounds = CGRectMake(40.0, 20.0, 120.0, 80.0)
var centerPoint = CGPointMake(96.0, 42.0)
```

Prefer the struct-scope constants `CGRect.infiniteRect`, `CGRect.nullRect`, etc. over global constants `CGRectInfinite`, `CGRectNull`, etc. For existing variables, you can use the shorter `.zeroRect`.


### Type Inference

The Swift compiler is able to infer the type of variables and constants. You can provide an explicit type via a type alias (which is indicated by the type after the colon), but in the majority of cases this is not necessary.

Prefer compact code and let the compiler infer the type for a constant or variable.

**Preferred:**
```swift
let message = "Click the button"
var currentBounds = computeViewBounds()
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
let message: String = "Click the button"
var currentBounds: CGRect = computeViewBounds()
```

**NOTE**: Following this guideline means picking descriptive names is even more important than before.


### Syntactic Sugar

Prefer the shortcut versions of type declarations over the full generics syntax.

**Preferred:**
```swift
var deviceModels: [String]
var employees: [Int: String]
var faxNumber: Int?
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
var deviceModels: Array<String>
var employees: Dictionary<Int, String>
var faxNumber: Optional<Int>
```


## Control Flow

Prefer the `for-in` style of `for` loop over the `for-condition-increment` style.

**Preferred:**
```swift
for _ in 0..<3 {
    println("Hello three times")
}

for (index, person) in enumerate(attendeeList) {
    println("\(person) is at position #\(index)")
}
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
for var i = 0; i < 3; i++ {
    println("Hello three times")
}

for var i = 0; i < attendeeList.count; i++ {
    let person = attendeeList[i]
    println("\(person) is at position #\(i)")
}
```


## Semicolons

Swift does not require a semicolon after each statement in your code. They are only required if you wish to combine multiple statements on a single line.

Do not write multiple statements on a single line separated with semicolons.

The only exception to this rule is the `for-conditional-increment` construct, which requires semicolons. However, alternative `for-in` constructs should be used where possible.

**Preferred:**
```swift
var swift = "not a scripting language"
```

**Not Preferred:**
```swift
var swift = "not a scripting language";
```

**NOTE**: Swift is very different to JavaScript, where omitting semicolons is [generally considered unsafe](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/444080/do-you-recommend-using-semicolons-after-every-statement-in-javascript)

## Resources

In `Swift` it's a good practice to use `struct` for accessing elements of asset catalogs, storyboards, custom colors and fonts. It helps to avoid the error-prone practice of hardcoding strings into your code.

```swift
struct ColorList {
  static let someColor = UIColor(hex: "343434")
}
```
