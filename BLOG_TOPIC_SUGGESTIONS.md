This is a list of ideas of what we would like to publish.

- CocoaPods vs Carthage vs Swift Package Manager (SPM).
  - What are our experiences with each one? Which do we like best, and why? What are their shortcomings in our experience?
- Dealing with people's names.
  - Dealing with names is hard, error-prone, etnocentric and excludes people . It doesn't have to be.
- Dealing with languages and localisation.
  - When does localising your app make sense. Is it hard? How hard? How do we do it? Do we do it?
- Stemming, lemmatisation and word separation.
  - Stemming, lemmatisation and word separation and three related forms of input normalisation that are often forgotten, misused or unknown to most programmers. It shouldn't be.
- Visual design v. user experience. (?)
  - When and why does one superseed the other? What should be the priority? Design is how it works. Making it pretty is a sideshow.
