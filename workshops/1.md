# B&B 1st iOS Workshop

First we started out by brainstorming possible discussion subjects:

</p>

Then we condesed this into notes we could vote on, this would help us to prioritize the most important topics first. We'd have time slots of 20 minutes, at the end of each slot we'd vote to continue for another 20 minutes or to close the topic.

- Discuss common problems in the work design
- Discuss about clients
- Talk about the future of the iOS team
- Discuss common problmes in the development process
- Discuss guidelines on contributing to open source
- Talk about our Unsplash client
- Discuss how things have been done so far
- Discuss common challenges
- Review playbook
- Revisit our iOS test for new hires

## Team

### Tracking and management
- A better tool than Jira is needed
- Sprint planning
- Backlog
- Estimates
- Track work, Harvest integration
- Retrospective tools, comparison between what you planned and what you did
- Link pull requests to Jira tasks

### Travis
Travis will be used for open source, but we'll remove it from our private projects because is too slow and breaks all the time. For private projects, we'll use an screenshot of Xcode with the tests passing instead, as a confirmation that the tests are working.

### Slack
We'll have 3 channels:
- #ios: General conversation
- #ios-pull-requests: Notifications about pull requests
- #ios-resources: Links for interesting articles and snippets

### GitHub

#### Pull requests
We'll have a pull-request buddie. This person will be your backup, as both your code reviewer as well as when you need to take some time off, in which case this person can pick up the project without much problem. Ideally, they should have as much information about the details of the project as you do, so make sure to keep in sync.

When reviewing a pull request and there's something missing or incorrect, first suggest the change, don't just make it. This helps ensure that you're not both fixing the same problem. We should add this to the Git guidelines.

We agree that the project owner will be the one merging the pull requests.

Finally, we agree that we need to make better pull request descriptions, adding screenshots, gifs, movies and steps to reproduce when needed.

#### Issues

We agreed on disabling GitHub issues for internal projects and moving all issue communication to Jira or similar tools.

### README

We'll include the project owner and project buddie to the README.

We agree that the README will have a small description of what the project is about in non-technical language.

### GIFs

Would be cool to have a better tool to make gifs or videos for our apps. We could provide a way to choose the type of device or simulator to use, amongst other things.

### Daily standups

We agreed that daily standups suck, specially since they are not asynchronous.

### Workshop

We think that the workshop was awesome, and we should try to have something similar on a smaller scale every so often.

### Articles

We want to write more articles. We talked about doing it in the simplest blogging platform we could find, so the threshold to publish a new post is super low, and basically help us to share fast and often.

We'll make a new blog post about fun things that we learned, gotchas that we found while solving a problem, and posts introducing any open source component that we do. We'lll also write about some of the solutions that came out of this workshop, such as architectural guidelies for code, sample projects, etc.

### Gists

We'll start use the gist feature from GitHUb more. It's a powerful tool to share snippets of code that delineate a problem, so we can quickly interate on it, without having to clone/build a whole project and get bogged down with details.

### Clients

When a new project gets assigned, we'll do a group brainstorming to look at the whole proposal for design or architectural flaws, to discuss the project, and how to go about implementing it, to make sure we're all in the same page.

We agreed that making clear which iOS versions will be suported from the start will help a lot to avoid misunderstandings or deadline issues. Also nomenclature. We should refer to them as  _iPhone apps_ when talking about an iPhone app instead of _iOS_, this sounds a bit obvious but we tend to use iOS which in reality implies both iPhone and iPad, when that is not always the case.

We are also going to try to not be assigned to more than one project at the time, and if it happens it shouldn't be in the same day. Also, we'll propose to change the effective working hours of an estimated day from 8 to 7. It's more realistic and should improve our estimate accuracy.

We agreed to add a testing phase to our estimates, this will account for 10% of the total amount of work. We'll make sure after each milestone that this testing phase is respected and that no new features are introduced. Basically, we want to ensure the quality of our deliveries, and pay of some of that technical debt.

We agreed that if it can't be reproduced, then is not a bug.

We agreed that being aware of when the customer is going to demo the projects is critical for better planning on our side. When it will be made, which devices will be used, etc. Also, that developers should be consulted on timeline of deliverables. It's really hard to estimate something, and people always understimate development time. This ends up souring relationships with clients, as deadlines are not met and projects get delayed.

We agreed to only work with our own backends whenever possible. If we're forced to use an external backend, to at least use a middle layer that eases some of the pain from dealing with poorly designed or hard to change external APIs.

Finally we need to *always* unit test the API calls, so far we haven't had a good experience working with APIs, so this might change in the future, but for now, we _Gotta Test 'Em All_.

### Collaboration with designers

We need to be aware of anti-patterns, UI choices that are too fragile and could easily break with the next iOS update. Diverging needlessly from the platform language. Adding too much visual fluff that takes a lot of time to develop and has very little pay-off. We should probably limit the amout of wowing fluff to one or two per project, at most. We work with a lot of startups and companies that will maintain our code in the future, so it's important for us to keep things in the native side as much as possible, to avoid future issues for them. In other words, if it involves a hack or going against the platform APIs, then it's probably a bad idea.

A few other common anti-patterns:
- Form fields without labels.
- Text only or textless buttons (with exceptions).
- Square buttons (rounded corners please).
- `X` for closing modals.
- Assets with differing corner radii.
- Over-complicated custom navigation flows
- Features hidden behind gestures or inscrutable icons (the Snapchat effect).

We discussed that doing more wireframing would be very helpful to check for early inconsistencies or flaws before there's too much work put into the design. Jumping straight into high fidelity designs might not be the best idea. More so for larger projects.

We need to respect the platforms, iOS, Android and web developers need to be aligned to make sure that designs don't just get recycled into new platforms, but instead that they are optimized for each platform. In other words, iOS should look and feel like iOS (even if a lot of it is custom or branded), Android should look and feel like Android, and Web is the Web.

We discussed that it would be great to make a Sketch plugin that would export the colors and fonts used in the app. Basically a button in Sketch that would create a Theme.swift file. One of the reasons that we want this is because in designs it's common to have colors with some transparency instead of flat colors, or backgrounds where the parent group is the one with the transparency, this is a mess to work with and having this tool would help a lot. We want to avoid real-time composition as much as possible, as it's harder to ensure the result is the wanted one, it's also more CPU/GPU expensive and can slow down animations.

We agreed that exploring a way to reuse some code between Framer and our iOS projects would be a big boost on collaboration between designers. The fact that they could tweak some of the UI by using tools that they know could help us all to be more efficient.

We also agreed on presenting the designers these points, to hear about their side of the collaboration with the iOS team, and look for ways for how we could reduce their pain-points as well.
